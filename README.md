### Terminal app

This is a simple terminal app that I've created. It supports pipes and redirection of I/O operations through the > and < operators.
To install the application, just run the "make" command. In order to run it, after making it run ./milestone\_3. 

The app is dependent on libreadline. In order to install it on ubuntu, run the command:

sudo apt install libreadline6 libreadline6-dev
